## TODO

for best compatibility we need to be able to serialize the objects in this library into the xml/xmi artifacts that omg supplies in their specification. refer to the [spec](https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5/PDF) Annex E.  
TODO thats a dead link, we need to find the actual xmi spec to use somewhere eventually.
